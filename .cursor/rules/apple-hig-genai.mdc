# Apple HIG ‚Äì Generative AI (Web-Optimized)

## Core Principles
1. **User agency** ‚Äì users initiate, review, edit, and can undo AI actions.
2. **Transparency** ‚Äì label AI outputs (e.g., "Generated by AI").
3. **Privacy first** ‚Äì prefer on-device models; disclose what data leaves the device and why.
4. **Inclusivity** ‚Äì design/test prompts and results with diverse users; avoid demographic assumptions.

## UX Patterns

### Prompting
‚Ä¢ Offer example prompts and inline tips; autocomplete suggestions improve success rates.
‚Ä¢ Prompt field: `<textarea rows="3">`, auto-expand on focus.

### Generation Flow
1. Submit ‚Üí disable input, show spinner.
2. If > 1 s, replace with token-stream or progress bar.
3. Provide **Stop** / **Regenerate** actions.

### Editing & Versioning
‚Ä¢ Present AI result in editable rich-text area.
‚Ä¢ Keep original as version 0 to allow **Revert**.
‚Ä¢ Common actions: **Copy**, **Save**, **Replace selection**.

### Error & Limitation Handling
‚Ä¢ If model uncertain, surface a notice and suggest revised prompts.
‚Ä¢ On API failure/offline, keep prompt intact and show retry toast.
‚Ä¢ Highlight that AI content may be inaccurate; encourage review.

## Data & Compliance
‚Ä¢ Send minimum required context; strip PII before request.
‚Ä¢ Ask explicit consent for analytics/training data collection.
‚Ä¢ Filter outputs for disallowed content (copyright, hate, personal data).
‚Ä¢ Adhere to regional AI regulations and model usage policies.

## Implementation Checklist
‚òë Label AI sections (`aria-describedby="ai-explainer"`).
‚òë Provide **Cancel** and **Undo** for AI actions.
