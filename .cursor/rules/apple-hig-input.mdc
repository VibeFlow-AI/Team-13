# Apple HIG Input (Web-Optimized)

## Text Fields
• Size field to expected data; optimise keyboards with `inputmode` (`email`, `tel`, `numeric`).
• Always display a `<label>`; placeholder is an optional hint, not a label.
• Enable browser autofill via `autocomplete` (e.g., `email`, `postal-code`).
• Provide a clear-all button (`<button aria-label="Clear">×</button>`).

## Structured Data
• Dates & times: use native `<input type="date|time">` where supported; provide fallback polyfill.
• Phone & card numbers: use masking library but allow manual typing for screen readers.
• Passwords: `<input type="password" autocomplete="current-password">` + visibility toggle.

## Choice Controls
• 2–5 choices: radio/segmented control inside `<fieldset>`.
• Long lists: searchable `<select>` or listbox; virtualise >100 items.
• Multi-select: checkbox list or tag picker; show selected count.

## Validation
• Validate on blur or after 500 ms pause; never on every keystroke.
• Indicate errors with color, icon, and text (`role="alert"`); maintain ≥4.5 : 1 contrast.
• On submit failure, focus the first invalid field; keep valid input intact.

## Form Flow
• Vertical stack, 8 px gap between fields, 24 px between logical groups.
• Natural tab order; `Enter` submits when form is valid.
• Either disable action buttons until valid **or** allow click then surface errors—pick one pattern consistently.

## Accessibility
• Each control has semantic label; group related inputs with `<fieldset>` + `<legend>`.
• Announce validation updates via `aria-live="polite"` region.
• Keep focus outline visible (`:focus-visible`); don't rely on color alone.
• Hit targets ≥44 px; maintain 8 px minimum spacing.

## File & Rich Inputs
• Use `accept` to limit file types; verify size before upload.
• Show upload progress with cancel option.
• Rich-text editor: expose bold/italic/list buttons with `aria-pressed` and keyboard shortcuts (⌘/Ctrl +B, ⌘/Ctrl +I).

- Handle paste operations from other applications
- Provide clear file type and size restrictions for uploads
- Show upload progress and allow cancellation
- Validate file types before upload
