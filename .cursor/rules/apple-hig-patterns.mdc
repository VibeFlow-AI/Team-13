# Apple HIG Patterns (Web-Optimized)

## Modals & Sheets
• Use semantic `<dialog>` (or div with `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"`) for focused tasks.
• Dismiss via close button **and** `Escape`; return focus to trigger element.
• Favor medium-sized overlays on desktop; full-screen modals only on small screens.
• Non-blocking **side sheets** (`<aside role="complementary">`) let users reference parent content.

## Alerts
• Reserve alerts for destructive or blocking confirmations.
• Title = concise question; buttons state outcomes ("Delete", "Cancel").
• Destructive buttons use red accent and `data-variant="destructive"`.
• Prefer inline feedback over frequent alerts to avoid interruption.

## Feedback & Loading
• Provide touch/hover feedback within 100 ms (opacity or ripple).
• Show spinner for tasks > 0.5 s; progress bar with %, or step count if length is known.
• Use skeleton placeholders for whole-page or list loads to reduce content shift.
• Always allow cancellation for operations expected to exceed 10 s.

## Accessibility
• Maintain logical heading order (`h1 → h2 → h3`).
• Define landmarks: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`. Use ARIA roles as fallback.
• Trap focus inside open dialogs; restore on close.
• Visible focus outline ≥ 2 px, 3 : 1 contrast.
• Announce dynamic region changes via `aria-live="polite"`.

## Errors & Validation
• Inline validation near field; summary alert at top for screen readers.
• Keep user input intact; autofocus first invalid control.
• Use friendly language, explain fix, avoid technical jargon.

- Explain what went wrong in clear, non-technical language
- Suggest specific steps to resolve errors
- Preserve user input when possible during error correction
- Provide alternative paths when primary action fails
