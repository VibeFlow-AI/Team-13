# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive mentorship platform that connects students with mentors through a structured onboarding process, matching algorithm, and session booking system. The platform serves two primary user personas: students seeking academic guidance and mentors offering their expertise. The system includes user onboarding, profile management, mentor-student matching, session booking with payment verification, and analytics dashboards.

3. WHEN the system calculates mentor rankings THEN it SHALL consider student's academic level, subject interests, and learning objectives
4. WHEN a student views mentor listings THEN the system SHALL display mentor expertise, experience, ratings, and availability
5. WHEN a student filters mentors THEN the system SHALL provide options to narrow results by subject, experience level, and availability
6. WHEN the matching algorithm runs THEN the system SHALL execute server-side to ensure performance and data security
